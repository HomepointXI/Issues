# HomepointXI Issue Tracker

Welcome to the HomepointXI server issue tracker. This is where we manage any bugs/issues that players may come across while playing on the server. This tracker helps us keep an organized list of what needs to be fixed, reviewed, looked into etc. to ensure the server is as close to bug free as possible.

## Exploit Reports

If you have found an exploit or other major bug that can result in unfair advantages or similar, please **DO NOT** report them here. 

Instead, exploits should be sent to an Admin or GM via a private message on our Discord:<br/>
Discord: [Homepoint XI Discord](https://discord.gg/aAAMAyK)


### Project Topaz (aka "Topaz") which all servers are based on has its own separate tracker here: https://github.com/project-topaz/topaz/issues
***When in doubt as to who to report your issue to, use **our** tracker and we will investigate/forward the issue to them if it is needed.***  
You may occasionally be asked if you can report an issue to Topaz if staff is unavailable, but we try to do that ourselves.
If you are **100% certain** the bug is **not** something you will need GM help with isn't specific to our custom content (an example is a Wonder NM) you can safely report the problem directly to them. 

**If the issue you would like to report concerns a Job Ability or Job Trait, do not report it here unless you are 100% certain it was already working. You can look up [every job on the wiki](http://wiki.HomepointXI.com/Category:Jobs) to see what works and what doesn't. Any ability or trait that doesn't yet exist is a Topaz problem, not a HomepointXI problem.**

## Issue Report Template

When you open a new issue on this tracker, a template will automatically fill in the input field that you can submit information with. 

Please **DO NOT** remove the template. Instead, simply fill it out like it's a survey/test. It is **important** that you follow the template otherwise your issue may be locked due to not following the rules. The template allows us to gather as much information as needed from you that you may not think of when reporting a bug.
